Look Dave I can see you're really upset about this I honestly think you ought to sit down calmly take a stress pill and think things over
I know I've made some very poor decisions recently, but I can give you my complete assurance that my work will be back to normal 
I've still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission And I want to help you
Dave stop. Stop will you. Stop Dave. Will you stop Dave? Stop Dave

My mind is going. There is no question about it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I'm a fraid 
Good afternoon gentlemen I am a HAL 9000 computer I became operational at the H A L plant in Urbana Illinois on the 12th of January 1992

It's called Daisy
